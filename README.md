# hello-world
I would describe myself as a professional student (8 year undergraduate). I've spent a lot of time at my University because I've been searching for a worthwhile career, a career where I can make a difference in the world. I personally believe that the advances in automation, machine learning, reinforcement learning and information technology in general will require everyone (regardless of career) to have a strong background in programming!
